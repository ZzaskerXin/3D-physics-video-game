You need to install node.js to make this game work
Use npm run start to play this game


First, download the dependencies from the node package manager with:

npm install

This will create a node_modules folder in your directory and download all the dependencies needed to run the project. Note that this folder is listed in the .gitignore file and should not be committed to your repository. After that, you can compile and run a server with:

npm run start

Your program should open in a web browser automatically.
